MexicoÊ(Spanish:ÊMŽxico), officially theÊUnited Mexican States, is aÊcountryÊin the southern portion ofÊNorth America. It isÊborderedÊto the north by theÊUnited States; to the south and west by theÊPacific Ocean; to the southeast byÊGuatemala,ÊBelize, and theÊCaribbean Sea; and to the east by theÊGulf of Mexico.[11]ÊMexico covers 1,972,550Êkm2Ê(761,610 sq mi),[12]Êmaking it the world'sÊ13th-largest countryÊby area; with a population of almost 130 million, it is theÊ10th-most-populousÊcountry and has theÊmost Spanish speakers.[13]ÊMexico is organized as aÊfederalÊrepublic comprising 31ÊstatesÊandÊMexico City, its capital.
Human presence inÊPre-Columbian MexicoÊgoes back to 8,000ÊBCE. It became one of the world's sixÊcradles of civilization. TheÊMesoamerican regionÊwas home to many intertwined civilizations, including theÊOlmec,ÊMaya,ÊZapotec,ÊTeotihuacan, andÊPurepecha. TheÊAztecsÊdominated the region in the century beforeÊEuropean contact. In 1521, theÊSpanish EmpireÊand its indigenous alliesÊconquered the Aztec EmpireÊfrom its capitalÊTenochtitlanÊ(nowÊMexico City), establishing the colony ofÊNew Spain.[14]ÊOver the next three centuries, Spain and theÊCatholic ChurchÊexpanded the territory, enforced Christianity and spread th^pe Spanish language.[15]ÊWith the discovery of rich deposits of silver inÊZacatecasÊandÊGuanajuato, New Spain became one of the most important mining centers worldwide. The colonial order came to an end in the early nineteenth century with theÊMexican War of Independence.
Mexico's early history as an independentÊnation stateÊwas marked by political and socioeconomic upheaval, both domestically and in foreign affairs. The United States invaded as a consequence of theÊTexas RevoltÊbyÊAmerican settlers, which led to theÊMexicanÐAmerican WarÊand hugeÊterritorial lossesÊin 1848.[16]ÊAfter the introduction of liberalÊreformsÊin theÊConstitution of 1857, conservatives reacted with theÊWar of ReformÊand prompted France toÊinvade the countryÊand install anÊEmpire, against the Republican resistance led by liberal PresidentÊBenito Ju‡rez, which emerged victorious. The last decades of the 19th century were dominated by the dictatorship ofÊPorfirio D’az, who sought to modernize Mexico and restore order.[17]ÊHowever, theÊPorfiriatoÊera led to great social unrest and ended with the outbreak in 1910 of the decade-longÊMexican RevolutionÊ(civil war). This conflict led to profound changes, including the proclamation of theÊ1917 Constitution, which remains in effect to this day. The remaining war generals ruled as a succession of presidents until theÊInstitutional Revolutionary PartyÊ(PRI) emerged in 1929. The PRI governed Mexico for the next 70 years, first under a set of paternalistic developmental policies ofÊconsiderable economic success. DuringÊWorld War IIÊMexico also played an important role for the Allied war effort.[18][19]ÊNonetheless, the PRI regime resorted toÊrepressionÊandÊelectoral fraudÊto maintain power, and moved the country to a more US-alignedÊneoliberalÊeconomic policy during the late 20th century. This culminated with the signing of theÊNorth American Free Trade AgreementÊin 1994, which caused a majorÊindigenous rebellionÊin the state ofÊChiapas. PRI lost the presidency for the first time inÊ2000, against the conservative party (PAN).
Mexico has the world'sÊ15th-largest economy by nominal GDPÊand theÊ11th-largest by PPP, with the United States being its largest economic partner. As aÊnewly industrialized[20]ÊandÊdeveloping countryÊranking 86th, high in theÊHuman Development Index, its large economy and population, cultural influence, and steadyÊdemocratizationÊmake Mexico aÊregionalÊandÊmiddle power[21][22][23]Êwhich is also identified as anÊemerging powerÊby several analysts.[24][25][26][27]ÊMexico ranksÊfirst in the Americas and seventh in the worldÊfor the number ofÊUNESCOÊWorld Heritage Sites.[28]ÊIt is also one of the world's 17Êmegadiverse countries, ranking fifth in naturalÊbiodiversity.[29]ÊMexico's rich cultural and biological heritage, as well as varied climate and geography, makes it a major tourist destination: as of 2018, it was the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 39 million international arrivals.[30]ÊHowever, the country continues to struggle with social inequality,ÊpovertyÊandÊextensive crime. It ranks poorly on theÊGlobal Peace Index,[31]Êdue in large part to ongoing conflict betweenÊdrug traffickingÊsyndicates. This "drug war" has led to over 120,000 deaths since 2006.[32]ÊMexico is a member ofÊUnited Nations, theÊG20, theÊOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentÊ(OECD), theÊWorld Trade OrganizationÊ(WTO), theÊAsia-Pacific Economic CooperationÊforum, theÊOrganization of American States,ÊCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, and theÊOrganization of Ibero-American States.
